# About Me

Engineer, open-sourcer, and ride-or-die no-code advocate. Based in the Netherlands, I am a no-code developer with a passion for transforming products worldwide and simplifying complexity. I build tools, launch products, and collaborate on innovations that make a difference, one idea at a time.

## My Work in the Community

I build and maintain plugins that enhance the no-code Bubble ecosystem, helping developers extend their capabilities and create more versatile applications. I also consult with startups to help turn ideas into MVPs, providing guidance on how to effectively use no-code to meet business goals.
