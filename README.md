# About Me

Software engineer, no-code nerd, teacher, and always ready to try something new. Based in the Netherlands, I'm a no-code advocate who loves building tools and launching products that make a difference. Whether I'm coding, mentoring, or experimenting, I aim to keep things simple and impactful. I'm a big fan of breaking down complex problems into straightforward solutions—one idea at a time.

I'm also pretty handy with Git; you could say I'm a surgeon when it comes to a good rebase.

## My Work in the Community

I build and maintain plugins that expand the no-code Bubble ecosystem, helping other developers create more versatile applications. I also consult with startups to turn ideas into MVPs, offering guidance on effectively using no-code to meet business goals.
